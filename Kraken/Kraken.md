out of almost half a million in bitcoin,

The streamer, Kitboga, features shows focused on provoking con artists. He tweeted yesterday that Kraken had created
a “tailored environment” for him to use in his most recent encounter with a cybercriminal, namely the one
pretending to be the president. The two have crossed paths previously. Before the last encounter,
they were in contact around a year ago.
